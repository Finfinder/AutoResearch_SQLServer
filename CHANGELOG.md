## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- GitHub Actions bumped to Node.js 24 runtime: `actions/checkout` v4→v5, `actions/setup-python` v5→v6, `actions/upload-artifact` v5→v6, `actions/download-artifact` v6→v7 across `release.yml`, `reusable-next-version-request.yml`, `reusable-open-next-version-branch.yml`, and `reusable-third-party-action-pinning.yml`

### Added

- `.github/workflows/third-party-action-pinning.yml` and `.github/workflows/reusable-third-party-action-pinning.yml` — repo-local mirror of the monorepo SHA-pinning guard enforcing full 40-character SHA for third-party actions (stage 1)

- `.github/actions-security/zizmor.yml` — repo-local mirror of the canonical zizmor policy for third-party action pinning

- Hybrid runtime validation for query variants: `main.py` now supports `--strict-validation`, `validator.py` can hash complete result sets, strict mode is also enabled automatically below 200 base rows, and unsupported legacy SQL types or oversized LOB values degrade explicitly back to row count validation
- `tests/test_validator.py` — strict validation coverage for full-result hashing, `ORDER BY` semantics, same-count semantic mismatches, fallback for legacy types / large LOBs, and canonicalization of datetime / float / XML values
- `tests/test_main_connection_lifecycle.py` — coverage for strict validation activation sources (`cli` / `auto`) and persistence of fallback metadata in `results.json`

### Changed

- `README.md` and `GUARDRAILS.md` — documentation updated to describe the hybrid validator, `--strict-validation`, automatic strict mode below 200 rows, ordering semantics, fallback rules, and the expanded `validation` contract in `results.json`

### Security

- `.github/workflows/reusable-version-consistency.yml`, `reusable-next-version-request.yml`, `reusable-open-next-version-branch.yml` — untrusted `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions moved from PowerShell `run:` blocks to `env:` variables and read via `$env:` to prevent expression injection attacks (GitHub Actions security best practice for `workflow_call` inputs)
- `tests/test_release_artifacts.py` — new contract test `test_reusable_workflows_pass_untrusted_inputs_via_environment_variables` verifies the `env:` + `$env:` pattern is enforced in all three reusable workflows

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/reusable-version-consistency.yml`, `reusable-next-version-request.yml`, `reusable-open-next-version-branch.yml` — synced to canonical mirror via centralized sync engine; removed cross-repo AI_Instruction checkout
- `.github/workflows/reusable-third-party-action-pinning.yml` — synced to repo-local policy bundle; policy resolved from `.github/actions-security/zizmor.yml` instead of cross-repo checkout
- `scripts/open-next-version-branch.ps1` — synced to canonical version
- `tests/test_release_artifacts.py` — moved `import main` inside test methods to decouple pyodbc import from pytest collection; extended with `test_third_party_action_pinning_uses_repo_local_policy_bundle`

### Fixed

- `scripts/open-next-version-branch.ps1` — replaced `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` with `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText` using `UTF8Encoding($false)` to prevent UTF-8 BOM from being written to `version.py` and `README.md` under PowerShell 5.1
- `tests/test_release_artifacts.py` — new contract test `test_open_next_version_script_writes_utf8_without_bom` verifies absence of `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` and presence of `WriteAllText` with no-BOM encoding

### Added

- Full release publishing for tagged versions: GitHub Release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`, a source ZIP for Python-based usage, and a standalone `win-x64` ZIP built with PyInstaller
- `scripts/build_release_artifacts.py` for assembling the source release bundle and `AutoResearch_SQLServer.spec` for the standalone one-folder build

### Changed

- `main.py` — refactored `_print_variant_result`, `_print_ranking`, and `main()` to reduce cognitive complexity: extracted private helpers for metric reporting (`_print_variant_header`, `_print_spill_warning`, `_print_variant_warnings`, `_print_aggregated_variant_metrics`, `_print_single_run_variant_metrics`, `_print_memory_grant`), ranking (`_get_ranking_value`, `_get_best_ranked_result`, `_print_best_rank_entry`, `_print_primary_ranking`), and benchmark orchestration (`_prepare_variant_execution`, `_run_single_variant`, `_run_multi_variant`, `_build_single_json_result`, `_build_multi_json_result`, `_build_raw_runs`, `_save_plan_if_present`); introduced `_VARIANT_WARNING_FORMAT` module-level constant to eliminate duplicated `"[%s]: %s"` logging literal; no change to CLI behavior or `results.json` format
- `tests/test_main_reporting.py` — new unit tests for `_print_variant_result` and `_print_ranking` (single-run and aggregated paths, spill summary, warning emission)
- `tests/test_main_connection_lifecycle.py` — extended with JSON result shape assertions (`test_single_run_collects_expected_json_result`, `test_multi_run_collects_expected_json_result`) and `warnings + guardrail_warnings` merge-order tests (`test_single_run_preserves_warning_merge_order`, `test_multi_run_preserves_warning_merge_order`)

- `main.py` now resolves `query.sql` from bundled resources and writes `.env`-driven runtime outputs (`results.json`, `logs/`, `plans/`) relative to the executable directory in frozen mode
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.github/workflows/version-consistency.yml`, and `.github/workflows/open-next-version-branch.yml` now call repository-local reusable workflows plus bundled PowerShell helpers, removing the hard dependency on reusable workflows hosted in the private `Finfinder/AI_Instruction` repository for this public repo.

- `.github/workflows/open-next-version-branch.yml`: automated next-version branch creation triggered by successful Release workflow; updates `version.py` and `README.md` with the `next_version` provided before the release
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: new Release workflow adapter uploading `next-version-request` artifact for the downstream next-version branch automation
- Repository-local release helpers: `.github/workflows/reusable-version-consistency.yml`, `.github/workflows/reusable-next-version-request.yml`, `.github/workflows/reusable-open-next-version-branch.yml`, plus PowerShell scripts in `scripts/`, so release validation and next-branch handoff can run without cross-repo workflow access

- `version.py`: canonical version source (`__version__ = "0.1.0"`) used by README badge and future version consistency checks
- Version badge in `README.md` linking to `version.py`
- Rule in `.github/instructions/autoresearch-sqlserver.instructions.md`: opening a new version branch requires updating `version.py` and `README.md` in the same change

- Variant composition — `_COMPOSABLE_TRANSFORMS` list (9 transforms, excluding `OR→UNION ALL` and `Index suggestions`) and `_apply_composed_transforms(ast)` function that generates all unordered pairs of single-transform results (up to 36 pairs for 9 transforms); composed variants appended after single-transform variants; labels use `"A + B"` format; `MAX_VARIANTS` applies to the combined total
- `tests/test_variants.py` — `TestComposedVariants` class (9 tests): verifies composed variants are generated, label format, specific pairs (`NOLOCK + RECOMPILE`, `JOIN→EXISTS + NOLOCK`), exclusion of non-composable transforms, SQL validity, `MAX_VARIANTS` enforcement, and no composition for trivial queries
- Connection pooling — benchmark connection opened once per `main.py` run and reused across all variant/run executions; `run_query` accepts optional `conn` parameter (backward-compatible: omitting `conn` preserves original per-call connection lifecycle); on error per run, connection is closed and a new one is opened before continuing with subsequent runs/variants (logged as INFO); `bench_conn` is always closed in the `finally` block regardless of benchmark outcome
- `tests/test_runner.py` — unit tests for `run_query` connection lifecycle: verifies external connections are never closed by `run_query`, own connections are always closed, and return format is preserved
- `tests/test_main_connection_lifecycle.py` — unit tests for `_reset_bench_conn` and `main()` connection lifecycle: verifies reset after error, continuation of benchmark, no unclosed connections after completion

### Changed

- `runner.py` — `run_query` signature extended with `conn=None`; connection is closed in `finally` only when created locally (`own_conn=True`)
- `main.py` — benchmark connection opened once before variant loop; all `run_query` calls pass `conn=bench_conn`; added `_reset_bench_conn` helper for connection reset after run errors; `bench_conn` closed in `finally` alongside existing `val_conn`

- `logging` module integration — stdlib `logging` replaces `print()` for all diagnostic output; two handlers: `StreamHandler(stderr)` at level controlled by `LOG_LEVEL` env var (default `INFO`) and `FileHandler` in `logs/` directory at `DEBUG` level; benchmark results (variant times, IO, CPU, ranking) additionally logged to file via dedicated `benchmark` logger (`propagate=False`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable — controls stderr verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`; invalid values fall back to `INFO`); readable from `.env` via `python-dotenv`
- `logs/autoresearch_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` — timestamped log file per run capturing full history (diagnostics + benchmark results); each run creates a new file in the `logs/` directory; covered by `*.log` in `.gitignore`
- `setup_logging()` function in `main.py` — configures loggers and handlers; called as first step in `main()`

### Changed

- `main.py` — diagnostic `print()` calls (`❌`, `⚠️`, `ℹ️`) migrated to `logger.error/warning/info()`; benchmark UI `print()` calls preserved on stdout and duplicated to `result_logger.info()` for file logging
- `runner.py` — 3 `print()` warning calls migrated to `logger.warning()`
- `variants.py` — 3 `print(file=sys.stderr)` calls migrated to `logger.warning()`; `import sys` removed
- `db.py` — `logger.debug()` added before `pyodbc.connect()` to log connection target (server/database/uid — password never logged)
- `.env.example` — `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` entry added with supported values documented
- `main.py` — runs each variant N times (default: 1, clamped to [1, 100]); cold cache (`DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS` / `DBCC FREEPROCCACHE`) is cleared before each individual run; execution plan and Query Store are collected from the first run only
- `aggregator.py` — pure aggregation module with `compute_stats(values)` (mean / median / stdev / min / max via `statistics` stdlib) and `aggregate_runs(run_results)` (aggregates `time` and `server_metrics`, preserves execution plan / Query Store from first run, skips error runs)
- `tests/test_aggregator.py` — 11 unit tests covering `compute_stats` (multi-value, single-value stdev=0, empty→None) and `aggregate_runs` (time/IO aggregation, first-run plan preservation, error run skipping, empty server_metrics, plan-loss edge case)

### Changed

- `runner.py` — `run_query(query)` gains optional `collect_plan=True` parameter; when `False`, `SET STATISTICS XML ON`, `_collect_execution_plan()`, and `_fetch_query_store()` are all skipped (returns `plan_xml=None, execution_plan={}, query_store=None`), reducing per-run overhead for multi-run benchmarks
- `main.py` — integrates `parse_args()` with argparse, `--runs N` loop over variants, and conditional JSON format: N=1 preserves flat backward-compatible format; N>1 adds `"runs"`, aggregated `"time"` / `"server_metrics"` dicts (mean/median/stdev/min/max), and `"raw_runs"` array; ranking uses median for N>1
- Console output for N>1: variant header shows `(N runs)`, time printed as `mean ± stdev (median)`, IO and CPU printed as medians

- `validator.py` — runtime row count validator: compares `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (<base>) AS _v` against each variant before benchmarking; mismatches block the variant with graceful degradation on failure
- `GUARDRAILS.md` — human-readable reference for guardrail rules, rationale, and guidance for adding new transforms
- `tests/test_guardrails.py` — 14 unit tests covering all guardrail rules (G1, G2, G4), edge cases (UNION exemption, SQL comments, unparseable SQL)
- `tests/test_validator.py` — 10 unit tests covering `get_row_count()` and `validate_row_count()` with mocked DB connections
- `TestCrossApply` class in `tests/test_variants.py` (3 tests) — covers `_transform_cross_apply`: produces `CROSS APPLY` label, SQL contains `CROSS APPLY` keyword, no variant produced when JOIN has no subquery

### Changed

- `main.py` — integrated guardrails and runtime validation: static check and row count check run before each `run_query()` call; blocked variants are skipped with 🚫 log; base row count computed once before the loop; connection reused across all validations and closed in `finally`; `results.json` entries extended with `validation` and `guardrail_warnings` fields
- `validator.py` — strip trailing `OPTION (...)` clauses before wrapping query in `COUNT(*)` subquery; OPTION hints (RECOMPILE, HASH JOIN, MERGE JOIN, LOOP JOIN) are invalid inside subqueries in T-SQL but don't affect row counts

### Removed

- `_transform_top_n` function and its entry in `_TRANSFORMS` list in `variants.py` — TOP N reduces the result set and is not a semantically equivalent optimisation; `TestTopN` class (3 tests) removed from `tests/test_variants.py`

### Changed

- `variants.py` — Cognitive Complexity refactor across 4 functions (all now ≤15):
  - Extracted `_attach_exists_to_where(ast_c, exists_expr)` module-level helper — used by `_transform_join_to_exists` (CC: 17→14)
  - Extracted `_build_correlated_exists(inner_select, inner_col, outer_col)` module-level helper — used by `_transform_in_to_exists` (CC: 17→13)
  - Extracted `_full_table_name(tbl)`, `_build_alias_map(ast)`, `_collect_cols_from(node, alias_map, candidates)` as module-level helpers — replaces nested closure pattern in `_collect_index_candidates` (CC: 31→8)
  - Extracted `_apply_transforms(ast, transform_fns)` module-level helper — used by `generate_variants` (CC: 16→9)
- `tests/test_variants.py` — branch coverage of `variants.py` improved from 82% to 89% due to `TestCrossApply` addition

### Fixed

- `variants.py` — `_transform_join_hints`: join hints are now emitted as `OPTION (HASH JOIN / MERGE JOIN / LOOP JOIN)` query hints instead of inline `method` attribute on the JOIN node; the inline form generated invalid T-SQL (`HASH JOIN t2 ...` without the required `INNER` keyword), causing SQL Server error 102

### Changed (gitignore)

- `.gitignore` — added `plans/` and `results.json` to ignored paths; both are runtime-generated artefacts and should not be version-controlled
- Removed `plans/plan_variant_*.sqlplan` and `results.json` from git tracking (`git rm --cached`)

- `sqlglot>=26.0` dependency — SQL parser for AST-based query transformations (zero transitive dependencies)
- `VariantGenerationError` exception in `variants.py` with structured fields: `line`, `col`, `fragment`, `suggestion` — raised when the base query cannot be parsed; provides precise error location for diagnosis
- 8 new SQL transformations in `variants.py`: `IN→EXISTS`, `OR→UNION ALL`, `DISTINCT→GROUP BY`, `Subquery→CTE`, `JOIN reorder`, `CROSS APPLY`, `HASH/MERGE/LOOP JOIN hints`, `Index suggestions`
- `MAX_VARIANTS` environment variable (default: `60`) — caps the number of generated variants per run; prints a warning on truncation
- `"label"` field in `results.json` — each result entry now includes the transformation name (e.g. `"JOIN→EXISTS"`, `"HASH JOIN"`)

### Changed

- `variants.py` — full rewrite: replaced 4 hardcoded `str.replace()` transformations with a dynamic AST-based generator using `sqlglot`. Generator parses any T-SQL query, detects structural patterns, and applies transformations automatically. Interface changed from `list[str]` to `list[tuple[str, str]]` (label, SQL).
- `main.py` — updated to handle the new `list[tuple[str, str]]` interface: iterates as `(label, query)`, displays transformation labels in test headers and ranking, adds `"label"` to `results.json`, catches `VariantGenerationError` with `sys.exit(1)`, handles empty variant list gracefully
- `tests/test_variants.py` — full rewrite: 48 unit tests covering all 12 transforms (pattern detected / pattern absent), `VariantGenerationError` fields, `MAX_VARIANTS` limit, interface contract, and SQL validity via `sqlglot.parse_one()` round-trip

- `pytest.ini` — formal pytest configuration with `pythonpath = .` (eliminates `sys.path` hacks), `testpaths = tests`, and test discovery patterns consistent with existing test conventions
- `tests/test_variants.py` — 6 unit tests for `generate_variants()` covering all 4 structural transformations (JOIN→EXISTS, TOP, NOLOCK, RECOMPILE) and the no-match edge case; no mocks required (pure function)
- `tests/test_db.py` — 6 unit tests for `get_connection()` covering env var validation (missing all / missing one), default and custom ODBC driver, connection string format, and return value; `pyodbc.connect` is fully mocked — no real database connection required
- `stats_parser.py` — pure-function module for parsing SQL Server diagnostic output:
  - `parse_io_stats(messages)` — regex parser for `SET STATISTICS IO` output from `cursor.messages`; sums logical/physical/read-ahead/lob reads across all tables in the query (handles JOIN scenarios)
  - `parse_time_stats(messages)` — regex parser for `SET STATISTICS TIME` output; extracts CPU time and elapsed time from the "Execution Times" section (excludes parse/compile phase)
  - `parse_execution_plan(xml_string)` — XML parser for actual execution plans from `SET STATISTICS XML`; extracts `MemoryGrant` (KB), `SpillToTempDb` warnings, list of physical operators, and runtime stats (`QueryTimeStats` CPU/elapsed, `RunTimeCountersPerThread` IO summed across operators)
- `tests/test_stats_parser.py` — 20 unit tests covering all parser functions with sample SQL Server message data (no database required); includes single-table IO, multi-table JOIN IO summing, combined TIME messages, XML plan with/without SpillToTempDb, invalid XML and None inputs, and runtime stats extraction (CPU/elapsed time, IO summing across operators)
- `plans/` directory — created automatically at runtime; stores actual execution plans as `.sqlplan` files (openable in SSMS)
- `.env.example` — environment variable template documenting all required connection parameters
- `README.md` — added project documentation with badges, quick start, configuration guide, project structure, and variant customization instructions

### Changed

- `tests/test_stats_parser.py` — removed `sys.path.insert()` hack (lines 2–5); imports now resolved natively via `pythonpath = .` in `pytest.ini`
- `runner.py` — `run_query()` now collects server-side diagnostics in addition to wall-clock time:
  - Enables `SET STATISTICS IO ON` and `SET STATISTICS TIME ON` before each query; parses IO and CPU/elapsed metrics from `cursor.messages` via `stats_parser`
  - Enables `SET STATISTICS XML ON` to capture the actual execution plan (iterates result sets via `while cursor.nextset()` loop to skip intermediate non-query sets); graceful degradation if `SHOWPLAN` permission is missing
  - Falls back to runtime stats from XML execution plan when `cursor.messages` is empty (ODBC Driver 18 behavior)
  - After execution, optionally queries `sys.query_store_runtime_stats` DMV for historical metrics; parameterized query (`?`) prevents SQL injection; graceful degradation if Query Store is disabled or permission is missing
  - Return type changed from `(duration, error)` tuple to a dict with keys: `time`, `error`, `server_metrics`, `execution_plan`, `plan_xml`, `query_store`, `warnings`
  - Wall-clock timing switched to `time.perf_counter()` for higher resolution and immunity to system clock adjustments
- `runner.py` — `run_query()` now executes `DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS` and `DBCC FREEPROCCACHE` before each benchmark measurement to ensure cold-cache conditions; requires `ALTER SERVER STATE` permission — if missing, a warning is printed and the benchmark continues without cache clearing (graceful degradation)
- `runner.py` — `run_query()` now closes the cursor and connection in a `finally` block, preventing connection leaks when queries fail or complete normally
- `main.py` — updated orchestrator for extended run results:
  - Per-variant output now includes server-side CPU time, IO reads, memory grant, and SpillToTempDb warnings
  - Saves actual execution plan XML to `plans/plan_variant_N.sqlplan` when available
  - Multi-criteria ranking at end of run: best by time, IO (logical reads), CPU, and memory grant
  - `results.json` extended with `server_metrics`, `execution_plan`, `execution_plan_file`, `query_store`, and `warnings` fields per variant
  - `pathlib.Path` used for `plans/` directory creation
- `query.sql` — updated base query to use AdventureWorks schema (`[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader]`, `[Sales].[Customer]`, `[CustomerID]`, `[OrderDate]`) with proper bracket notation
- `variants.py` — updated JOIN→EXISTS and NOLOCK variant transformations to match the new AdventureWorks table and column names
- `db.py` — added `TrustServerCertificate=yes` to connection string; credentials are now read from environment variables (`DB_SERVER`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_UID`, `DB_PWD`, `DB_DRIVER`) instead of being hardcoded
- `README.md` — updated Installation, Configuration, Quick Start and How It Works sections; added permissions table for graceful degradation; updated project structure with `stats_parser.py`, `tests/`, `plans/`
- `requirements.txt` — added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`

### Fixed

- `runner.py` — `_fetch_query_store()` LIKE pattern now correctly matches queries containing bracket-quoted identifiers (e.g. `[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader]`): square brackets are escaped as `[[]`, and whitespace sequences are replaced with `%` wildcards to match regardless of `\r\n` vs `\n` vs space differences between the submitted query and the text stored by Query Store
- `stats_parser.py` — extracted `_extract_runtime_stats(root, ns)` helper from `parse_execution_plan()` to reduce Cognitive Complexity to within SonarQube limit
- `runner.py` — extracted `_clear_cache(cursor)` and `_collect_execution_plan(cursor, warnings)` helpers from `run_query()` to reduce Cognitive Complexity to within SonarQube limit

### Security

- Eliminated hardcoded SQL Server credentials that triggered SonarQube violations `python:S2068` (Credentials should not be hard-coded) and `secrets:S6703` (Database passwords should not be disclosed)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-04
