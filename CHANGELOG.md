## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Variant composition — `_COMPOSABLE_TRANSFORMS` list (9 transforms, excluding `OR→UNION ALL` and `Index suggestions`) and `_apply_composed_transforms(ast)` function that generates all unordered pairs of single-transform results (up to 36 pairs for 9 transforms); composed variants appended after single-transform variants; labels use `"A + B"` format; `MAX_VARIANTS` applies to the combined total
- `tests/test_variants.py` — `TestComposedVariants` class (9 tests): verifies composed variants are generated, label format, specific pairs (`NOLOCK + RECOMPILE`, `JOIN→EXISTS + NOLOCK`), exclusion of non-composable transforms, SQL validity, `MAX_VARIANTS` enforcement, and no composition for trivial queries
- Connection pooling — benchmark connection opened once per `main.py` run and reused across all variant/run executions; `run_query` accepts optional `conn` parameter (backward-compatible: omitting `conn` preserves original per-call connection lifecycle); on error per run, connection is closed and a new one is opened before continuing with subsequent runs/variants (logged as INFO); `bench_conn` is always closed in the `finally` block regardless of benchmark outcome
- `tests/test_runner.py` — unit tests for `run_query` connection lifecycle: verifies external connections are never closed by `run_query`, own connections are always closed, and return format is preserved
- `tests/test_main_connection_lifecycle.py` — unit tests for `_reset_bench_conn` and `main()` connection lifecycle: verifies reset after error, continuation of benchmark, no unclosed connections after completion

### Changed

- `runner.py` — `run_query` signature extended with `conn=None`; connection is closed in `finally` only when created locally (`own_conn=True`)
- `main.py` — benchmark connection opened once before variant loop; all `run_query` calls pass `conn=bench_conn`; added `_reset_bench_conn` helper for connection reset after run errors; `bench_conn` closed in `finally` alongside existing `val_conn`


- `logging` module integration — stdlib `logging` replaces `print()` for all diagnostic output; two handlers: `StreamHandler(stderr)` at level controlled by `LOG_LEVEL` env var (default `INFO`) and `FileHandler` in `logs/` directory at `DEBUG` level; benchmark results (variant times, IO, CPU, ranking) additionally logged to file via dedicated `benchmark` logger (`propagate=False`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable — controls stderr verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`; invalid values fall back to `INFO`); readable from `.env` via `python-dotenv`
- `logs/autoresearch_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` — timestamped log file per run capturing full history (diagnostics + benchmark results); each run creates a new file in the `logs/` directory; covered by `*.log` in `.gitignore`
- `setup_logging()` function in `main.py` — configures loggers and handlers; called as first step in `main()`

### Changed

- `main.py` — diagnostic `print()` calls (`❌`, `⚠️`, `ℹ️`) migrated to `logger.error/warning/info()`; benchmark UI `print()` calls preserved on stdout and duplicated to `result_logger.info()` for file logging
- `runner.py` — 3 `print()` warning calls migrated to `logger.warning()`
- `variants.py` — 3 `print(file=sys.stderr)` calls migrated to `logger.warning()`; `import sys` removed
- `db.py` — `logger.debug()` added before `pyodbc.connect()` to log connection target (server/database/uid — password never logged)
- `.env.example` — `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` entry added with supported values documented

 — runs each variant N times (default: 1, clamped to [1, 100]); cold cache (`DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS` / `DBCC FREEPROCCACHE`) is cleared before each individual run; execution plan and Query Store are collected from the first run only
- `aggregator.py` — pure aggregation module with `compute_stats(values)` (mean / median / stdev / min / max via `statistics` stdlib) and `aggregate_runs(run_results)` (aggregates `time` and `server_metrics`, preserves execution plan / Query Store from first run, skips error runs)
- `tests/test_aggregator.py` — 11 unit tests covering `compute_stats` (multi-value, single-value stdev=0, empty→None) and `aggregate_runs` (time/IO aggregation, first-run plan preservation, error run skipping, empty server_metrics, plan-loss edge case)

### Changed

- `runner.py` — `run_query(query)` gains optional `collect_plan=True` parameter; when `False`, `SET STATISTICS XML ON`, `_collect_execution_plan()`, and `_fetch_query_store()` are all skipped (returns `plan_xml=None, execution_plan={}, query_store=None`), reducing per-run overhead for multi-run benchmarks
- `main.py` — integrates `parse_args()` with argparse, `--runs N` loop over variants, and conditional JSON format: N=1 preserves flat backward-compatible format; N>1 adds `"runs"`, aggregated `"time"` / `"server_metrics"` dicts (mean/median/stdev/min/max), and `"raw_runs"` array; ranking uses median for N>1
- Console output for N>1: variant header shows `(N runs)`, time printed as `mean ± stdev (median)`, IO and CPU printed as medians


- `validator.py` — runtime row count validator: compares `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (<base>) AS _v` against each variant before benchmarking; mismatches block the variant with graceful degradation on failure
- `GUARDRAILS.md` — human-readable reference for guardrail rules, rationale, and guidance for adding new transforms
- `tests/test_guardrails.py` — 14 unit tests covering all guardrail rules (G1, G2, G4), edge cases (UNION exemption, SQL comments, unparseable SQL)
- `tests/test_validator.py` — 10 unit tests covering `get_row_count()` and `validate_row_count()` with mocked DB connections
- `TestCrossApply` class in `tests/test_variants.py` (3 tests) — covers `_transform_cross_apply`: produces `CROSS APPLY` label, SQL contains `CROSS APPLY` keyword, no variant produced when JOIN has no subquery

### Changed

- `main.py` — integrated guardrails and runtime validation: static check and row count check run before each `run_query()` call; blocked variants are skipped with 🚫 log; base row count computed once before the loop; connection reused across all validations and closed in `finally`; `results.json` entries extended with `validation` and `guardrail_warnings` fields
- `validator.py` — strip trailing `OPTION (...)` clauses before wrapping query in `COUNT(*)` subquery; OPTION hints (RECOMPILE, HASH JOIN, MERGE JOIN, LOOP JOIN) are invalid inside subqueries in T-SQL but don't affect row counts

### Removed

- `_transform_top_n` function and its entry in `_TRANSFORMS` list in `variants.py` — TOP N reduces the result set and is not a semantically equivalent optimisation; `TestTopN` class (3 tests) removed from `tests/test_variants.py`

### Changed

- `variants.py` — Cognitive Complexity refactor across 4 functions (all now ≤15):
  - Extracted `_attach_exists_to_where(ast_c, exists_expr)` module-level helper — used by `_transform_join_to_exists` (CC: 17→14)
  - Extracted `_build_correlated_exists(inner_select, inner_col, outer_col)` module-level helper — used by `_transform_in_to_exists` (CC: 17→13)
  - Extracted `_full_table_name(tbl)`, `_build_alias_map(ast)`, `_collect_cols_from(node, alias_map, candidates)` as module-level helpers — replaces nested closure pattern in `_collect_index_candidates` (CC: 31→8)
  - Extracted `_apply_transforms(ast, transform_fns)` module-level helper — used by `generate_variants` (CC: 16→9)
- `tests/test_variants.py` — branch coverage of `variants.py` improved from 82% to 89% due to `TestCrossApply` addition

### Fixed

- `variants.py` — `_transform_join_hints`: join hints are now emitted as `OPTION (HASH JOIN / MERGE JOIN / LOOP JOIN)` query hints instead of inline `method` attribute on the JOIN node; the inline form generated invalid T-SQL (`HASH JOIN t2 ...` without the required `INNER` keyword), causing SQL Server error 102

### Changed (gitignore)

- `.gitignore` — added `plans/` and `results.json` to ignored paths; both are runtime-generated artefacts and should not be version-controlled
- Removed `plans/plan_variant_*.sqlplan` and `results.json` from git tracking (`git rm --cached`)

- `sqlglot>=26.0` dependency — SQL parser for AST-based query transformations (zero transitive dependencies)
- `VariantGenerationError` exception in `variants.py` with structured fields: `line`, `col`, `fragment`, `suggestion` — raised when the base query cannot be parsed; provides precise error location for diagnosis
- 8 new SQL transformations in `variants.py`: `IN→EXISTS`, `OR→UNION ALL`, `DISTINCT→GROUP BY`, `Subquery→CTE`, `JOIN reorder`, `CROSS APPLY`, `HASH/MERGE/LOOP JOIN hints`, `Index suggestions`
- `MAX_VARIANTS` environment variable (default: `60`) — caps the number of generated variants per run; prints a warning on truncation
- `"label"` field in `results.json` — each result entry now includes the transformation name (e.g. `"JOIN→EXISTS"`, `"HASH JOIN"`)

### Changed

- `variants.py` — full rewrite: replaced 4 hardcoded `str.replace()` transformations with a dynamic AST-based generator using `sqlglot`. Generator parses any T-SQL query, detects structural patterns, and applies transformations automatically. Interface changed from `list[str]` to `list[tuple[str, str]]` (label, SQL).
- `main.py` — updated to handle the new `list[tuple[str, str]]` interface: iterates as `(label, query)`, displays transformation labels in test headers and ranking, adds `"label"` to `results.json`, catches `VariantGenerationError` with `sys.exit(1)`, handles empty variant list gracefully
- `tests/test_variants.py` — full rewrite: 48 unit tests covering all 12 transforms (pattern detected / pattern absent), `VariantGenerationError` fields, `MAX_VARIANTS` limit, interface contract, and SQL validity via `sqlglot.parse_one()` round-trip


- `pytest.ini` — formal pytest configuration with `pythonpath = .` (eliminates `sys.path` hacks), `testpaths = tests`, and test discovery patterns consistent with existing test conventions
- `tests/test_variants.py` — 6 unit tests for `generate_variants()` covering all 4 structural transformations (JOIN→EXISTS, TOP, NOLOCK, RECOMPILE) and the no-match edge case; no mocks required (pure function)
- `tests/test_db.py` — 6 unit tests for `get_connection()` covering env var validation (missing all / missing one), default and custom ODBC driver, connection string format, and return value; `pyodbc.connect` is fully mocked — no real database connection required
- `stats_parser.py` — pure-function module for parsing SQL Server diagnostic output:
  - `parse_io_stats(messages)` — regex parser for `SET STATISTICS IO` output from `cursor.messages`; sums logical/physical/read-ahead/lob reads across all tables in the query (handles JOIN scenarios)
  - `parse_time_stats(messages)` — regex parser for `SET STATISTICS TIME` output; extracts CPU time and elapsed time from the "Execution Times" section (excludes parse/compile phase)
  - `parse_execution_plan(xml_string)` — XML parser for actual execution plans from `SET STATISTICS XML`; extracts `MemoryGrant` (KB), `SpillToTempDb` warnings, list of physical operators, and runtime stats (`QueryTimeStats` CPU/elapsed, `RunTimeCountersPerThread` IO summed across operators)
- `tests/test_stats_parser.py` — 20 unit tests covering all parser functions with sample SQL Server message data (no database required); includes single-table IO, multi-table JOIN IO summing, combined TIME messages, XML plan with/without SpillToTempDb, invalid XML and None inputs, and runtime stats extraction (CPU/elapsed time, IO summing across operators)
- `plans/` directory — created automatically at runtime; stores actual execution plans as `.sqlplan` files (openable in SSMS)
- `.env.example` — environment variable template documenting all required connection parameters
- `README.md` — added project documentation with badges, quick start, configuration guide, project structure, and variant customization instructions

### Changed

- `tests/test_stats_parser.py` — removed `sys.path.insert()` hack (lines 2–5); imports now resolved natively via `pythonpath = .` in `pytest.ini`
- `runner.py` — `run_query()` now collects server-side diagnostics in addition to wall-clock time:
  - Enables `SET STATISTICS IO ON` and `SET STATISTICS TIME ON` before each query; parses IO and CPU/elapsed metrics from `cursor.messages` via `stats_parser`
  - Enables `SET STATISTICS XML ON` to capture the actual execution plan (iterates result sets via `while cursor.nextset()` loop to skip intermediate non-query sets); graceful degradation if `SHOWPLAN` permission is missing
  - Falls back to runtime stats from XML execution plan when `cursor.messages` is empty (ODBC Driver 18 behavior)
  - After execution, optionally queries `sys.query_store_runtime_stats` DMV for historical metrics; parameterized query (`?`) prevents SQL injection; graceful degradation if Query Store is disabled or permission is missing
  - Return type changed from `(duration, error)` tuple to a dict with keys: `time`, `error`, `server_metrics`, `execution_plan`, `plan_xml`, `query_store`, `warnings`
  - Wall-clock timing switched to `time.perf_counter()` for higher resolution and immunity to system clock adjustments
- `runner.py` — `run_query()` now executes `DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS` and `DBCC FREEPROCCACHE` before each benchmark measurement to ensure cold-cache conditions; requires `ALTER SERVER STATE` permission — if missing, a warning is printed and the benchmark continues without cache clearing (graceful degradation)
- `runner.py` — `run_query()` now closes the cursor and connection in a `finally` block, preventing connection leaks when queries fail or complete normally
- `main.py` — updated orchestrator for extended run results:
  - Per-variant output now includes server-side CPU time, IO reads, memory grant, and SpillToTempDb warnings
  - Saves actual execution plan XML to `plans/plan_variant_N.sqlplan` when available
  - Multi-criteria ranking at end of run: best by time, IO (logical reads), CPU, and memory grant
  - `results.json` extended with `server_metrics`, `execution_plan`, `execution_plan_file`, `query_store`, and `warnings` fields per variant
  - `pathlib.Path` used for `plans/` directory creation
- `query.sql` — updated base query to use AdventureWorks schema (`[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader]`, `[Sales].[Customer]`, `[CustomerID]`, `[OrderDate]`) with proper bracket notation
- `variants.py` — updated JOIN→EXISTS and NOLOCK variant transformations to match the new AdventureWorks table and column names
- `db.py` — added `TrustServerCertificate=yes` to connection string; credentials are now read from environment variables (`DB_SERVER`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_UID`, `DB_PWD`, `DB_DRIVER`) instead of being hardcoded
- `README.md` — updated Installation, Configuration, Quick Start and How It Works sections; added permissions table for graceful degradation; updated project structure with `stats_parser.py`, `tests/`, `plans/`
- `requirements.txt` — added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`

### Fixed

- `runner.py` — `_fetch_query_store()` LIKE pattern now correctly matches queries containing bracket-quoted identifiers (e.g. `[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader]`): square brackets are escaped as `[[]`, and whitespace sequences are replaced with `%` wildcards to match regardless of `\r\n` vs `\n` vs space differences between the submitted query and the text stored by Query Store
- `stats_parser.py` — extracted `_extract_runtime_stats(root, ns)` helper from `parse_execution_plan()` to reduce Cognitive Complexity to within SonarQube limit
- `runner.py` — extracted `_clear_cache(cursor)` and `_collect_execution_plan(cursor, warnings)` helpers from `run_query()` to reduce Cognitive Complexity to within SonarQube limit

### Security

- Eliminated hardcoded SQL Server credentials that triggered SonarQube violations `python:S2068` (Credentials should not be hard-coded) and `secrets:S6703` (Database passwords should not be disclosed)
